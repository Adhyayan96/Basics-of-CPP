Here I documented my journey to make a solid foundation in basics of CPP programming, before diving deep into DSA.

## Topics covered :
1. Variables, Data types & Operators 
2. If Else
3. While loop
4. Nested if else
5. Switch Statement

## Projects :
1. Calculator (curently can do calculation upto 2 numbers) 
I'm just changing this readme to learn how to push changes in github through vscosde.
